#### Description: Automating a SAP script is crucial for enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and productivity within an organization. SAP, being a comprehensive enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, involves a multitude of repetitive and time-consuming tasks that, when performed manually, are prone to human error. By automating these scripts, companies can streamline their operations, significantly reducing the time required to execute various processes. For instance, tasks such as data entry, report generation, and transaction processing can be automated to ensure consistency and precision, minimizing the risk of errors that could lead to costly mistakes and compliance issues. Automation also facilitates real-time data processing and reporting, enabling faster decision-making and enhancing the responsiveness of the business to market changes. Moreover, it allows employees to focus on more strategic and value-added activities rather than mundane and repetitive tasks, thereby improving job satisfaction and operational morale. Automation in SAP can also contribute to cost savings by reducing the need for extensive manual labor and lowering the incidence of operational disruptions caused by human errors. Furthermore, it supports scalability, as automated processes can handle increased workloads more efficiently than manual methods. This is particularly beneficial for growing businesses that need to manage larger volumes of transactions without proportionally increasing their workforce. In addition to these benefits, automation can ensure compliance with internal policies and external regulations by enforcing standardized processes and maintaining comprehensive logs of all activities for audit purposes. As technology evolves, integrating advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning with SAP automation can further enhance predictive analytics and decision-making capabilities. In summary, automating SAP scripts is a strategic move that can drive significant improvements in efficiency, accuracy, productivity, and compliance within an organization, providing a competitive edge in todayâ€™s fast-paced business environment.

How the project  works:

1) Insert SAP Login, SAP Password and SAP .EXE file path into 'sapCred' python file
2) Pip install -r requirements.txt
3) Create virtual environment called 'venv'
4) Execute de run.bat to activate the venv and start the project script
5) Extract production by month and year of choice
6) Select with Production Center to extract data from
7) Save .csv files
8) Launch Streamlit dashboard to analyse .csv files
